1. Write advantages of using PHP in web applications.

    Performance. PHP scripting language is executed faster than scripts written in other coding languages such as ASP and JSP. 
    Open-Source. 
    Familiarity with the Syntax. 
    Embedded. 
    Platform Independent.
    Database Support. 
    Error Reporting.
    Loosely Typed Language.

2. Write the output from the following.

echo greeting;
?>

    have some error in code. 


3. Explain the difference between == and === using a suitable example.

    The main difference between the two operators is how they compare values. The == operator compares the values of two variables after performing type conversion if necessary. On the other hand, the === operator compares the values of two variables without performing type conversion.

4. Define an array with 5 animals, "Lion","Wolf","Dog","Leopard" and "Tiger".

a) Print the array using a foreach loop to get the following output.
Lion
Wolf
Dog
Leopard
Tiger

 $animal = array("Lion","Wolf","Dog","lepord","Tiger");

 foreach($animal as $value){
    echo "$value <br>";
 }




b). If the length of the animal is greater than 4, replace it with “Pass” and print the
elements again.

if(count($animal)>4){
    echo "Pass";
}
